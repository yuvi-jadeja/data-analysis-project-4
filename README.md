Optimizing Diwali Sales: A Data Analysis Project Using Python

In this project, I employed Python to analyse a company's sales data during the Diwali season. The goal was to uncover actionable insights to help the company enhance its sales strategies and boost revenue during this crucial period.

Using Python's powerful data analysis libraries, such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, I performed a comprehensive analysis of the sales data. Key aspects included identifying top-selling products, analysing customer purchasing behaviour, and detecting sales patterns across different regions and demographics.

The insights derived from this analysis provided valuable recommendations for inventory management, targeted marketing campaigns, and pricing strategies. This project highlights my ability to leverage Python for data analysis to drive informed business decisions and improve sales performance during high-demand seasons.
